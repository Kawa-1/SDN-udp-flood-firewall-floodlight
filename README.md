# SDN UDP Flood Firewall with Floodlight Controller

## Overview

This project implements a UDP flood firewall using the Floodlight controller, an open-source OpenFlow controller, in a Software Defined Network (SDN) environment. The goal is to mitigate UDP flood attacks by dynamically adjusting flow rules in response to network conditions. Based on the number of requests within a specific time frame, the system will block a user attempting a DDoS attack.

## Prerequisites

All required packets and files with needed version are located in ```topology/requirments.txt```

## Installation

To run project Linux distribution is needed. It can be chosen by the futere user but need to be compatible with all prerequisites

## Configuration

In this topology, a central point is represented by a switch serving as the core. Connected to this switch are four PC terminals, comprising two "legitimate" hosts alongside two "malicious" hosts, intended to simulate attack scenarios. Additionally, the switch interfaces with a controller, while a server is also linked to the switch to complete the network setup.

## How to run it?

```sudo mn --custom path/to/topology/topology.py --topo mytopo```

## Traffic generation:

Within our topology, we simulate two distinct types of traffic. The first involves a typical WWW server setup, hosting various files of different sizes. PC1 and PC3 are configured to download these files, representing standard HTTP traffic. The second type of traffic consists of UDP packets generated by Packit, leading to the simulation of a UDP flood attack.

Before generating UPD flood attack you need to intall generator ```sudo apt install packit -y```. To perform attack bash script was made (we need to have continuous traffic from PCs). After executing, it generates following output in xterm of chosen host.
